        "In this notebook we will be implementing a (slightly modified version) of the Transformer model from the [Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) paper. All images in this notebook will be taken from the Transformer paper. For more information about the Transformer, [see](https://www.mihaileric.com/posts/transformers-attention-in-disguise/) [these](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/) [three](http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html) articles.\n",

        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Similar to the Convolutional Sequence-to-Sequence model, the Transformer does not use any recurrence. It also does not use any convolutional layers. Instead the model is entirely made up of linear layers, attention mechanisms and normalization. \n",
        "\n",
        "As of January 2020, Transformers are the dominant architecture in NLP and are used to achieve state-of-the-art results for many tasks and it appears as if they will be for the near future. \n",
        "\n",
        "The most popular Transformer variant is [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) (**B**idirectional **E**ncoder **R**epresentations from **T**ransformers) and pre-trained versions of BERT are commonly used to replace the embedding layers - if not more - in NLP models. \n",
        "\n",
        "A common library used when dealing with pre-trained transformers is the [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) library, see [here](https://huggingface.co/transformers/pretrained_models.html) for a list of all pre-trained models available.\n",
        "\n",
        "The differences between the implementation in this notebook and the paper are:\n",
        "- we use a learned positional encoding instead of a static one\n",
        "- we use the standard Adam optimizer with a static learning rate instead of one with warm-up and cool-down steps\n",
        "- we do not use label smoothing\n",
        "\n",
        "We make all of these changes as they closely follow BERT's set-up and the majority of Transformer variants use a similar set-up."

        "Similar to the ConvSeq2Seq model, the Transformer's encoder does not attempt to compress the entire source sentence, $X = (x_1, ... ,x_n)$, into a single context vector, $z$. Instead it produces a sequence of context vectors, $Z = (z_1, ... , z_n)$. So, if our input sequence was 5 tokens long we would have $Z = (z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4, z_5)$. Why do we call this a sequence of context vectors and not a sequence of hidden states? A hidden state at time $t$ in an RNN has only seen tokens $x_t$ and all the tokens before it. However, each context vector here has seen all tokens at all positions within the input sequence.\n",

        "\n",
        "First, the tokens are passed through a standard embedding layer. Next, as the model has no recurrent it has no idea about the order of the tokens within the sequence. We solve this by using a second embedding layer called a *positional embedding layer*. This is a standard embedding layer where the input is not the token itself but the position of the token within the sequence, starting with the first token, the `<sos>` (start of sequence) token, in position 0. The position embedding has a \"vocabulary\" size of 100, which means our model can accept sentences up to 100 tokens long. This can be increased if we want to handle longer sentences.\n",
        "\n",
        "The original Transformer implementation from the Attention is All You Need paper does not learn positional embeddings. Instead it uses a fixed static embedding. Modern Transformer architectures, like BERT, use positional embeddings instead, hence we have decided to use them in these tutorials. Check out [this](http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html#positional-encoding) section to read more about the positional embeddings used in the original Transformer model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, the token and positional embeddings are elementwise summed together to get a vector which contains information about the token and also its position with in the sequence. However, before they are summed, the token embeddings are multiplied by a scaling factor which is $\\sqrt{d_{model}}$, where $d_{model}$ is the hidden dimension size, `hid_dim`. This supposedly reduces variance in the embeddings and the model is difficult to train reliably without this scaling factor. Dropout is then applied to the combined embeddings.\n",
        "\n",
        "The combined embeddings are then passed through $N$ *encoder layers* to get $Z$, which is then output and can be used by the decoder.\n",
        "\n",
        "The source mask, `src_mask`, is simply the same shape as the source sentence but has a value of 1 when the token in the source sentence is not a `<pad>` token and 0 when it is a `<pad>` token. This is used in the encoder layers to mask the multi-head attention mechanisms, which are used to calculate and apply attention over the source sentence, so the model does not pay attention to `<pad>` tokens, which contain no useful information."
